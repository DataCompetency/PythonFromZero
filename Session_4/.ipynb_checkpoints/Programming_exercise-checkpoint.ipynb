    "## How to?\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, there are most of the time several ways to achieve a task! Sometimes, certain ways are better in terms of runtime, memory consumption, readability, etc. But we should not worry too much about this as beginners. If the code works correctly, that is good, and we can take care of optimizing it afterwards if we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/stupid_but_it_works.jpg\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A general advice, from personal experience, is to divide (programming) tasks into many smaller steps that seem more manageable. A first division is already given to us above: The overall task is to write a black jack game. This task is then already divided into 8 smaller steps, sometimes even with hints on how to achieve this. We can now go through the 8 sub-tasks and try to solve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a concrete task like step 1, it can also help to think about the problem backwards, starting with the desired outcome. Determine what you _want to have_ after the task is done, and then think about what you _immediately need_ to get it. Then, think about what you would need to have to get the preriquisites for the desired outcome, and how to get that. Continue until you know where to start. This quickly gets easier and faster with a bit of practice.\n",
